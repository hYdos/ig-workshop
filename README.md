# igToolbox
(another) all in one solution for editing Alchemy Games. It is **NOT** going to replace igCauldron. It still has its place. This tool will be a work in progress for a while as far as I know, and is just an experiment I'm trying out and an excuse to rewrite/semi-port igLibrary for my other projects. Its secondary main goal is user functionality making it as easy to use without instructions as possible. If you use _this tool at the moment I will not provide support it is **nowhere near done**, though suggestions are welcome :)

# Harass me to add these (Or PR them for me üôè)
- ability to load more than 1 game at once (no static state üò¢ )
- transfer igObject tool (for multiple game instances)
- undo/redo tracking
- extension system for writing custom egui handlers for igObject's which can use them.
- store version info in about button for user bugs
- search bar for files and igObject's
- keeping igLibrary, igToolbox, and igExtensions separate (igExtensions is the tools to make igObjects user readable like texture importer/exporter, model importer/exporter, level editor/viewer, etc)
- write down type of integer stuff is (helps with knowing max/min value or intended value)
- igx support for maff (should be really easy tbh)
- igb support for saves
- deep copy (copy all children) and surface copy (keep references)
- proper asset extraction (allow exporting of wav's, vvl's, and other assets)
